    <p>Hi! I'm Mrs. Stacy Smith and I teach 6th grade reading and creative writing at Ridgefield Elementary. I received my bachelor's degree in elementary education from State College, which is also where I met my husband, Tim.  He and I have two beautiful children, plus two dogs and a cat.</p>
    <p>If you need to contact me, you can call the main school phone number or you can email me at ssmith@ridgefield.k12.us.</p>
