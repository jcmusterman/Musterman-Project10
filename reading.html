<p>Book Recommendation</p>
<p>If you're looking for a good independent reading book, I would suggest any of the Harry Potter books.  Even if you've already seen all the movies, the books are still worth reading.  They go into more depth with all of the characters, their motivations, and lots of scenes that never even made it into the movies!  I promise you won't be disappointed!</p>

<p>Book Review: Inkheart</p>
<p>There are some people who, when they read a story out loud, really make the characters and events come alive.  In the world of "Inkheart," there are a few people whose voices are so powerful, that when they read a story aloud, people and creatures actually come to life.  This is great when you're bringing to life cute little animals or magical fairies, but not so good when you bring out an evil villain and his henchmen. Not only that, but for every person or creature that comes out of a book, something from our world goes in.</p>
<p>That's how a young girl's mother disappeared and the reason why her father keeps them moving around a lot so that they can't be found by the evil villain who wants him to read more of his henchmen out of the book "Inkheart."</p>
<p>This book is not only a great adventure, but it's full of great characters and interesting plot twists.  Without giving too much away, some elements of the story have a happy ending while others leave you sure that a sequel is sure to follow.  It's a bit of a long book, but it's worth the time!</p>
